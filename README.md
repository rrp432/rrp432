# 👋 Hi, I’m Rudra Patel

I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys building real-world systems that solve actual problems. I work mostly with Java and Spring Boot on the backend, and I’m comfortable with React and Android on the frontend. I’ve had hands-on experience with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and tools like Redis, Firebase, and OpenAI’s API.

Over the past year, I’ve worked in a backend role where I built and improved REST APIs, optimized performance, and collaborated in a team using Agile methods. I’m always up for learning new technologies and improving my skills, whether it’s writing cleaner code, testing better, or understanding system design more deeply.

## 🕵️‍♂️ A Little Secret

Some of the projects I’ve worked on aren’t public due to academic rules and team restrictions.  
But don’t worry—I’d be happy to share the code or walk you through a demo over Zoom. Just say the word 😄
