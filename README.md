# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rudra Patel

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who enjoys building real-world systems that solve actual problems. I work mostly with Java and Spring Boot on the backend, and Iâ€™m comfortable with React and Android on the frontend. Iâ€™ve had hands-on experience with databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and tools like Redis, Firebase, and OpenAIâ€™s API.

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve worked in a backend role where I built and improved REST APIs, optimized performance, and collaborated in a team using Agile methods. Iâ€™m always up for learning new technologies and improving my skills, whether itâ€™s writing cleaner code, testing better, or understanding system design more deeply.
